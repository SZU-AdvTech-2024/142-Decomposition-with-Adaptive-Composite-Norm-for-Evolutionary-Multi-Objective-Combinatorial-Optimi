    abstract = "The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) decomposes a multi-objective problem into a series of single-objective subproblems for collaborative optimization. The weighted sum (WS) method and the Tchebycheff (TCH) method are the two most popular scalarization methods. They have pros and cons in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) the WS method allows MOEA/D to converge faster than the TCH method; the WS-based MOEA/D cannot obtain unsupported non-dominated vectors, while the TCH-based one can overcome this shortcoming. This inspired us to use the WS method to drive the population towards the Pareto front and then switch to the TCH method to maintain a more diverse population. To better balance convergence and diversity, we propose a new scalarization strategy called adaptive composite norm (ACN). The ACN strategy can combine the WS and the TCH with dynamic weighting. The experiments consider 16 instances including 4 MOCOPs and run on the PlatEMO. Results reveal that MOEA/D-ACN can rank first and significantly outperform the other evolutionary multi-objective combinatorial optimization algorithms on almost all instances.",
